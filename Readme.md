🌾 **Crop Yield Prediction — Machine Learning Project**

📌 **Overview**

This project aims to predict **crop yield (hg/ha)** using classical Machine Learning models based on environmental and agricultural data.
It demonstrates a full end-to-end Data Science workflow including:
- Data collection and loading
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature preprocessing
- Model training and comparison
- Performance evaluation
- Model interpretation
- Conclusions and real-world applications

The goal is to build a baseline model capable of supporting agricultural decision-making in real scenarios (cooperatives, agtechs, government agencies, farms, insurance, trading, etc.).
